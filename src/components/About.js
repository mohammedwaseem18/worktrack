                Employee management is the process by which employers ensure
                workers perform their jobs to the best of their abilities so as
                to achieve business goals. It typically entails building and
                maintaining healthy relationships with employees, as well as
                monitoring their daily labor and measuring progress. In this
                way, employers can identify opportunities for improvement and
                recognize achievements.

                Employee management matters because lackluster workforce
                performance typically increases operating expenses. Not only
                that, but having to hire replacements or additional team members
                is time consuming and costly in its own right. By identifying
                problems and creating action plans for improvement, employers
                may be able to get the most out of their existing workforce and
                avoid unnecessary terminations.

                Employee management systems are important because a business’s
                workforce is its greatest asset. Yet, despite this intrinsic
                value, employee engagement is sometimes overlooked because HR
                professionals are either too busy with administrative work or
                lack the integrations necessary to use their people data
                effectively. Technology can alleviate such burdens and afford
                employers more time to connect with workers and create strategic
                initiatives that will attract and retain talent.

                When employers choose to outsource their responsibilities to a
                third party, it’s sometimes referred to as employee management
                services. This arrangement is often beneficial for small and
                midsized businesses who have limited HR departments, lack
                compliance expertise or want to offer employee benefits
                comparable to those commonly available at larger organizations.
                Reducing the amount of time and resources spent on employee
                management also affords business owners the ability to focus
                more attention on growing their operations.
